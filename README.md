    ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</h1>

# About

The Attendance Management System is a web-based application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It aims to streamline school management, class organization, and facilitate communication between students, teachers, and administrators.

## Features

- **User Roles:** The system supports three user roles: Admin, Teacher, and Student. Each role has specific functionalities and access levels.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can add new students and teachers, create classes and subjects, manage user accounts, and oversee system settings.

- **Attendance Tracking:** Teachers can easily take attendance for their classes, mark students as present or absent, and generate attendance reports.

- **Data Visualization:** Students can visualize their attendance data through interactive charts and tables, helping them to understand their class present at a glance.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js, Material UI, Redux
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB

# Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HT3163/Attendance-Management-System---MERN-PROJECT
Open 2 terminals in separate windows/tabs.

Terminal 1: Setting Up Backend 
```sh
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Create a file called .env in the backend folder.
Inside it write this :

```sh
MONGO_URL = mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/attenmern11
```
If you are using MongoDB Compass you can use this database link but if you are using MongoDB Atlas then instead of this link write your own database link.

Terminal 2: Setting Up Frontend
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Now, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser. 
The Backend API will be running at `localhost:5000`.

# Error Solution

You might encounter an error while signing up, either a network error or a loading error that goes on indefinitely.

To resolve it:

1. Navigate to the `frontend > .env` file.

2. Uncomment the first line. After that, terminate the frontend terminal. Open a new terminal and execute the following commands:
```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

After completing these steps, try signing up again. If the issue persists, follow these additional steps to resolve it:

1. Navigate to the `frontend > src > redux > userRelated > userHandle.js` file.

2. Add the following line after the import statements:

```javascript
const REACT_APP_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000";
```
